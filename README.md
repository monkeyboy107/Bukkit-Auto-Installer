# Bukkit-Auto-Installer
#This is made to work on Ubuntu. In the future I plan on making it more widely available to other distros 
#This is a simple thing that will automatically download and install the minecraft bukkit server and all that is required for it
#You will still have to change the EULA of the for the current directory installer bukkit server 
#The command minecraftServer will make the ~/home/minecraft/Server/ as where the server files will be 
#The command minecaftServerShortcut makes the current directory as the server directory
