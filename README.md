# Bukkit-Auto-Installer
## This is made to work on Ubuntu. In the future I plan on making it more widely available to other distros 
## This is a simple thing that will automatically download and install the minecraft bukkit server and all that is required for it
## The command minecraftServer will make the ~/home/minecraft/server/ as where the server files will be 
## The command minecaftServerShortcut makes the current directory as the server directory
## The cronjob.sh will make the server at boot of the server start the mineraft server
